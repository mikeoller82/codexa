### 🔧 Technical Architecture

#### New Modules Added
- `codexa/execution.py` - Complete task execution and tracking system
- `codexa/codegen.py` - Advanced code generation and file creation engine
- Enhanced `codexa/core.py` - Integrated all systems with intelligent routing
- Enhanced `codexa/planning.py` - Full workflow with requirements and tasks

#### Intelligent Systems
- **Request Routing** - Planning → Task Execution → Code Generation → Core
- **Project Detection** - Automatically detects JavaScript, Python, React, Flask, etc.
- **Context Awareness** - Maintains project context across all operations
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of interruptions and edge cases

### 🌟 Usage Examples

#### Complete Workflow Example
```bash
# 1. Initialize new project
cd my-new-app
codexa init

# 2. Start comprehensive planning
codexa
# User: "Build a Flask web app with user authentication and dashboard"
# Codexa: Creates plan.md → requirements.md → tasks.md

# 3. Execute tasks step by step
/next-task    # Starts first task with AI guidance
/next-task    # Continues to next task
/tasks        # Show all tasks with progress

# 4. Generate specific files
# User: "Create a login component in React"
# Codexa: Automatically generates src/components/Login.jsx

# 5. Track progress
/task-status  # Shows completion percentage and current task
/status       # Shows complete project status
```

#### Direct Code Generation
```bash
codexa
# User: "Write a Flask app.py with user authentication"
# Codexa: Generates complete Flask application with auth

# User: "Create a config.json for database settings"
# Codexa: Generates configuration file with proper structure

# User: "Generate a React Login component"  
# Codexa: Creates src/components/Login.jsx with full implementation
