## Technical Architecture

### Error Handling Flow:
1. **Error Detection** → Context Creation → Classification → Recovery Attempt
2. **Recovery Success** → Analytics Update → User Notification
3. **Recovery Failure** → User Guidance → Manual Intervention Path

### Integration Points:
- **Enhanced Core**: All operations wrapped with error contexts
- **Command System**: Error handling in command execution pipeline  
- **MCP Service**: Health monitoring and automatic recovery
- **Provider System**: Intelligent failover and retry logic
- **Plugin Manager**: Secure execution with error boundaries

### Data Flow:
- **User Action** → Context Recording → Suggestion Generation
- **Error Occurrence** → Classification → Recovery Strategy → User Guidance
- **Session Activity** → Analytics Collection → Improvement Recommendations
